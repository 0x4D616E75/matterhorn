This one will just need to iterate over all teams to stop all Aspell
instances once we start one for each team:
src/Matterhorn/App.hs:91:    case finalSt^.csCurrentTeam.tsEditState.cedSpellChecker of

csCurrentTeamId:

This team ID should be the one that owns the channel provided to updateChannelNotifyProps:
src/Matterhorn/State/Channels.hs:1141:    tId <- use csCurrentTeamId

This should iterate over all connected teams rather than just writing the state for the current team:
src/Matterhorn/LastRunState.hs:78:        tId = cs^.csCurrentTeamId
