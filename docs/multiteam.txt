Multi-team support TODO list
----------------------------

 * Maybe we don't want to display the current team in the channel list
   if there is a team list at the top of the window?

 * Check on how we could extend the notification script API to include
   the team name and/or ID.

 * Support rearranging the team list (keybinding to shift left/right)
   and update the user prefs when doing so (category="teams_order" and
   name="").
