Multi-team support TODO list
----------------------------

 * There needs to be some indication in the UI for which teams have
   unread activity.

 * Maybe we don't want to display the current team in the channel list
   if there is a team list at the top of the window?

 * The title bar update for the unread channel count needs to only take
   effect for the current team and needs to be refreshed on team switch.

 * Check on how we could extend the notification script API to include
   the team name and/or ID.

 * Support rearranging the team list (keybinding to shift left/right)
   and update the user prefs (category="teams_order" and name=""). Also
   honor the preference at startup when populating the team list and
   sort any unmentioned teams alphabetically.
