Multi-team support TODO list
----------------------------

 * There needs to be some indication in the UI for which teams have
   unread activity.

 * Maybe we don't want to display the current team in the channel list
   if there is a team list at the top of the window?

 * Is there a server event that tells us we have been added to a new
   team? Probably WMAddedToTeam.

 * Is there a server event that tells us we have been removed from a
   team? Probably:
    * WMTeamDeleted
    * WMLeaveTeam

 * Are there other team-related events that we should pay attention to?
   Probably WMUpdateTeam.
