Multi-team support TODO list
----------------------------

 * There needs to be some indication in the UI for which teams have
   unread activity.

 * Is there a server event that tells us we have been added to a new
   team? Probably WMAddedToTeam.

 * Is there a server event that tells us we have been removed from a
   team? Probably:
    * WMTeamDeleted
    * WMLeaveTeam

 * Are there other team-related events that we should pay attention to?
   Probably WMUpdateTeam.

 * When switching teams, we need to update the view timestamp for the
   current channel of the team we are switching to.

 * When we get a new message in a team's current channel when that team
   is NOT the currently-viewed team, we need to treat that like the user
   is not looking at the channel (i.e. set the New Messages line and do
   NOT update the view timestamp). This should basically be the same
   logic we already have for the "not the current channel" case.
