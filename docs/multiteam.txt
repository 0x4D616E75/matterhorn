Multi-team support TODO list
----------------------------

 * There needs to be some indication in the UI for which teams have
   unread activity.

 * Maybe we don't want to display the current team in the channel list
   if there is a team list at the top of the window?

 * Is there a server event that tells us we have been added to a new
   team? Probably WMAddedToTeam.

 * Is there a server event that tells us we have been removed from a
   team? Probably:
    * WMTeamDeleted
    * WMLeaveTeam

 * Are there other team-related events that we should pay attention to?
   Probably WMUpdateTeam.

 * The title bar update for the unread channel count needs to only take
   effect for the current team and needs to be refreshed on team switch.

 * Check on how we could extend the notification script API to include
   the team name and/or ID.

 * Support rearranging the team list (keybinding to shift left/right)
   and update the user prefs (category="teams_order" and name=""). Also
   honor the preference at startup when populating the team list and
   sort any unmentioned teams alphabetically.

 * showChannelInSidebar uses csCurrentTeam a few times. Is that correct?
   I don't think so. I think it should use the team that owns the
   channel (or all teams if a DM channel).
