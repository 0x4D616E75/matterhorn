30802.1.0
=========

This release supports server version 3.8.2. This release is our first
official public release.

Package changes:
 * Removed stale array and data-default dependencies
 * Increased lower bound on base dependency to 4.8 to relect our GHC
   testing.

Improvements:
 * Subprocess error logs are now only created on demand. Previously we
   created them on startup before any subprocess errors had occurred.
 * We now provide a QuickCheck test for some infrastructure.

Bug fixes:
 * Fixed a bug whereby some resize operations would cause a program
   crash by triggering an unsafe mutable vector operation in Vty.
 * New user creation is now handled successfully and no longer requires
   a client restart to function reliably. Previously bad behavior
   included not coloring new users' names and not showing new users'
   names at all on their messages.
 * Message selection mode is no longer blocked by errors and other
   non-post content.
 * Subprocesses that fail to run are now consistently mentioned in the
   subprocess error log.

30802.0.0
=========

This release supports server version 3.8.2.

Package changes:
* Relax constraint on containers to allow 0.5.7 or greater.
* Upgraded mattermost-api to 30802.0.0.

Bug fixes:
* The help interface now updates properly when showing either the main
  help window or the scripts help window.
* Attachments are now saved asynchronously.
* Attachments are now opened without using the browser, thus removing
  our dependency on a valid browser session with the server (fixes #128)
* Editing state is now saved before switching history entries (fixes
  #210)
* Messages with unknown authors trigger a user metadata fetch (fixes #205)

New keybindings:
* C-o now opens the URL list while scrolling through channel messages.
* C-c now cancels channel selection in C-g mode

UI changes:
* Channel scroll mode keybindings were added to the help page.
* We no longer perform string highlighting on the contents of Markdown
  code spans in messages.
* On startup, only the scrollback for Town Square is fetched to improve
  performance. Scrollback for other channels is fetched on demand.
* We now use the channel sigil "~" rather than "#" to match the web
  client behavior, and highlight ~-prefixed channel names (fixes #204).

30701.0.0
=========

This release supports server version 3.7.1.

New features:
 * Matterhorn now has basic support for 3.7's new "group channel"
   feature. If other users add you to a group channel, it will appear in
   the sidebar with the member usernames listed (e.g. "#bob, sue, ...").
   Creation of group channels will be supported in a future release.
 * When the `urlOpenCommand` program produces output on standard output
   or standard error, this output is now logged and a message is posted
   in the current channel with the path to the log file. This feature
   prevents the URL open command from poisoning the terminal state with
   unexpected output.
 * Added a `/members` command to show current channel membership.
 * Channel header changes from other users will now cause the channel
   topic string to update.
 * Added a `/delete-channel` command to delete the current channel.
 * Markdown rendering now puts empty lines between adjacent block
   elements of the same variety to improve readability.

Bug fixes:
 * Message selection now only supports reply/edit/delete on normal posts
   (fixes #174)
 * C-n/p now only change channels when a non-DM channel is selected
   (fixes #82)
 * We now handle new user events (fixed #111)
 * On channel change we now always reset the channel list to scroll to
   the top (fixes #138)
 * When a draft message is left in the editor when changing channels, a
   new sigil ("Â»") appears for the previous channel instead of the usual
   "#" to indicate this.
 * The help interface now resizes properly all the time.

Performance improvements:
 * On startup, all channel contents are fetched asynchronously. Town
   Square fetches are prioritized. These changes drastically improve
   startup time, even on fast connections.

Documentation changes:
 * The README now includes a feature list, a brief feature overview for
   new users, and a section on how to contribute.

Package changes:
 * Upgraded mattermost-api to 30701.0.0.
 * Binary releases now include the copyright and licensing information
   for all dependencies.

Internal changes:
 * Added preemption support for asynchronous work queue processing.
   `doAsync(With)` now both take an `AsyncPriority`.

30600.2.4
=========

New editing keybindings:
 * C-w, M-Backspace now delete the word to the left of the cursor.
 * M-d deletes the word to the right of the cursor.
 * C-k now kills text from the cursor to the end of the line and copies
   to an internal buffer; C-y pastes from said buffer.
 * C-b, C-f move back and forward by one word, respectively.

* Many editing keybindings are now present in their own Help page
  section.

Package changes:
 * Upgraded text-zipper to 0.10.
 * Upgraded mattermost-api to 30600.2.2.

30600.2.3
=========

Bug fixes:
 * Message-yanking failures due to missing programs (e.g. xclip) no
   longer trigger an unhandled exception (fixes #170)
 * Users that are not members of the current team are now hidden from
   the user list (fixes #161)
 * User statuses in the sidebar are now periodically refreshed
 * Supported server commands now appear on the help screen (fixes #162)
 * Files containing non-UTF-8 content no longer trigger unhandled
   exceptions when being read by matterhorn (fixes #168)
 * Updated repository URL in error message about reporting problems
   (thanks @tommd)

30600.2.2
=========

* Improved formatting of message attachments so that their filenames
  are shown. Previously only their hash identifiers were displayed. This
  change also entails asynchronous fetching of attachment metadata.
* Upgraded to mattermost-api 30600.2.1.

30600.2.1
=========

* Fixed a bug that caused message selection mode to trigger a Vty crash
  when a message being rendered was larger than half of the area
  available for the message list.

30600.2.0
=========

* Added a new message selection mode. This mode provides access to four
  new features: replies, edits, deletion, and verbatim text yanking. To
  enter this mode, use the default binding of C-s (and cancel with Esc).
  The resulting cursor can be used to select messages in the current
  channel and perform the following actions on them:

  * y: for messages with any verbatim text, yank the verbatim text to
    the first verbatim block in the message to the system clipboard
    (works on Linux and OSX)
  * r: reply to the selected message. To cancel a reply, press C-c or
    Esc.
  * e: for messages written by the current user, edit the selected
    message. To cancel an edit, press C-c or Esc.
  * d: for messages written by the current user, delete the selected
    message (with a confirmation).
  * o: for messages containing URLs, open all URLs in the selected
    message.
  * j/k/up/down/pgup/pgdown: change the selected message cursor
    position.

* Added a C-r binding to begin a reply to the most recently posted
  message in the current channel.
* M-e now toggles multiline editing mode rather than just enabling it.
  Previously, Esc toggled it off.
* Upgraded to mattermost-api 30600.2.0.

30600.1.0
=========

* Upgraded to mattermost-api 30600.1.0. This fixed /me and /shrug
  server-side command execution failures.

30600.0.0
=========

Initial versioned release for server verison 3.6.0.
